# My-coding-example
That's code example of my work in Pixlpark during last year. I was in charge of the choice of delivery by the buyer and everything connected with it, from the delivery page on the site to the order registration control in the administrative panel.

In the above repository, a lot has been cut out because it is a commercial product. Unfortunately, I didn't have any inspiration for pet projects, but I'm ready to take a test to show my skills.
